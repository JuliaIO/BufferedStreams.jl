Hence, if you are using a source that requires closing of an underlying system resource like file IO or socket, ensure you implement a close method in your source. This may be important for on-access locking file systems as in the MS Windows OS.","category":"page"},{"location":"inputstreams/#Anchors","page":"Input Streams","title":"Anchors","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"inputstreams/","page":"Input Streams","title":"Input Streams","text":"Input streams also have some tricks to make parsing applications easier. When parsing data incrementally, one must take care that partial matches are preserved across buffer refills. One easy way to do this is to copy it to a temporary buffer, but this unecessary copying can slow things down.","category":"page"},{"location":"inputstreams/","page":"Input Streams","title":"Input Streams","text":"Input streams instead support the notion of \"anchoring\", which instructs the stream to save the current position in the buffer. If the buffer gets refilled, then any data in the buffer including or following that position gets shifted over to make room. When the match is finished, one can then call takeanchored! return an array of the bytes from the anchored position to the currened position, or upanchor! to return the index of the anchored position in the buffer.","category":"page"},{"location":"inputstreams/","page":"Input Streams","title":"Input Streams","text":"# print all numbers literals from a stream\nstream = BufferedInputStream(source)\nwhile !eof(stream)\n    b = peek(stream)\n    if '1' <= b <= '9'\n        if !isanchored(stream)\n            anchor!(stream)\n        end\n    elseif isanchored(stream)\n        println(ASCIIString(takeanchored!(stream)))\n    end\n    read(stream, UInt8)\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"#BufferedStreams","page":"Home","title":"BufferedStreams","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: ) (Image: ) (Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov) (Image: ) (Image: Project Status: Inactive) (Image: Chat on Discord)","category":"page"},{"location":"#Description","page":"Home","title":"Description","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"BufferedStreams provides buffering for IO operations.
